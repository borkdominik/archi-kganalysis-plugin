    "description": "This smell arises when an EA repository has excessive and dense dependencies without any particular structure.",
    "context": "Derived from: \"Dense Structure\"",
    "detection": "We prepare a graph for each repository to detect the smell. Each component is treated as a node and any reference from the component to another component is treated as an edge. We then compute the average degree of the graph (|E|/|V|). A graph with more than 1.75 average degree suffers from this smell. (One could also test the clustering coefficient)",
    "consequences": "Modifications to the system may be cumbersome and many dependencies have to be added, due to the high coupling.",
    "cause": "Inefficient abstraction that needs high coupling of components to work.",
    "solution": "Extensive restructuring and rethinking of the architecture is needed, if the problems get noticeable.",
