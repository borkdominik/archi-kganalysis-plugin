### Eclipse RCP

Archi is developed based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP).  
âžœ [RCP Page containing Ressources](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Rich_Client_Platform)

Eclipse application consists of individual software components, called *plug-ins* (e.g. new menu entries, toolbar entries). Eclipse RCP application typically uses the same base components as the Eclipse IDE and also add application-specific components on top. Core Components of the Eclipse Platform:
- **OSGi**, specification for modular Java applications
- **Equinox**, implementation of the OSGi specification, used by Eclipse 
- **SWT**,  standard  user  interface  component  library  used  by Eclipse (+ JFace)
- **Workbench**, provides framework for the application, responsible for all other UI components

Important configuration files:
- `MANIFEST.MF`, contains OSGi configuration information (API and dependencies)
- `plugin.xml`, contains Eclipse specific extension mechanisms, *Extension-points* (interfaces  for plug-ins  to  contribute  functionality) and *Extensions* (functionality)
